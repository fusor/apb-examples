# Work-Around
# The OpenShift's s2i (source to image) requires that no ENTRYPOINT exist
# for any of the s2i builder base images.  Our 's2i-apb' builder uses the
# apb-base as it's base image.  But since the apb-base defines its own
# entrypoint.sh, it is not compatible with the current source-to-image.
#
# The below work-around checks if the entrypoint was called within the
# s2i-apb's 'assemble' script process. If so, it skips the rest of the steps
# which are APB run-time specific.
#
# Details of the issue in the link below:
# https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/issues/475
